            I am a passionate software engineer with expertise across all phases of the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC), 
            utilizing both Waterfall and Agile/Scrum methodologies.
            My skill set includes front-end development with HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, TypeScript, Angular, and React, 
            as well as back-end development using Node.js and Java/J2EE technologies.

            I specialize in creating dynamic Single Page Applications (SPAs) using the MEAN stack and have experience with Spring Boot for developing microservices. 
            My proficiency extends to database management, including SQL and NoSQL databases, and integrating microservices with messaging systems like Apache Kafka.
            I am adept at leveraging cloud technologies, particularly AWS, and utilize tools like Jenkins for CI/CD and Docker for containerization.
            I am committed to building robust, scalable applications and continuously improving my skills in software engineering.
